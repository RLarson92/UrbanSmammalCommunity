# UrbanSmammalCommunity
A repository that contains the data and code for:

Larson, R.N., and H. A. Sander. Variation in species-specific responses to habitat fragmentation and land cover structure urban small mammal communities. *Journal of Mammalogy*. 105:1-13.


This `README` file includes information on the various scripts and datasets used for this analysis. Not every data source is saved in this repository (e.g., GIS data). The manuscript contains citations for where to access the geospatial data.


<h2>Scripts</h2> </div>

**./fit_model.R:** R script that cleans and processes the data, runs the community abundance model, and summarizes the model output

<h2>Folders</h2>
<h3>JAGS</h3>

There is 1 file in this folder, `./JAGS/dynamicCommunityModel.R`, which is the Bayesian community abundance model code to pass to JAGS.

<h3>functions</h3>

There are 4 files in this folder, all utility functions that automate or declutter some of the R code

**.functions/logit2prob.R:** Function script to convert a logit value to a probability

**.functions/split_mcmc.R:** Function to split a model's MCMC matrix into a list of named objects, one for every parameter. Makes graphing results much easier. Credit for this code goes to [@mfidino](https://github.com/mfidino) [(see his blog post here)](https://masonfidino.com/split_mcmc/)

**.functions/wide_to_stacked.R:** Function to convert a wide-format data frame (i.e., one site per row with one column for each observation) into a stacked format data frame (one observation per row, with sites/seasons/etc. "stacked" on top of each other). Modified from code in [a vignette for the `umbs` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ubms/vignettes/random-effects.html).

**.functions/wideObs_to_stacked.R:** Function script to convert observation-level covariate data from a wide format to a 'stacked' format. Different from `wide_to_stacked.R` in that it does not add a 'Species' column to the resulting dataframe. Modified from code in [a vignette for the `umbs` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ubms/vignettes/random-effects.html).

<h3>landscapes</h3>

There is 1 subfolder and 1 file in this folder. The contents of this folder are for creating the contagion index values for each site (see the manuscript for more details).

**./landscapes/connectivity.R:** R script for calculating habitat fragmentation (i.e., contagion index) for each trapping plot

<h3>landscapes/tifs</h3>

This subfolder contains `.tif` files of the land cover of each small mammal trapping plot. There are 45 files in here, so I'm not going to list them all, but they are named after their site number: e.g., `1.tif`, `124.tif`, etc.
